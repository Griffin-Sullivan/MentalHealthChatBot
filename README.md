# MentalHealthChatBot
The MentalHealthChatBot is a prototype mobile app for supporting people with mental health symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Our app supports 4 main use cases:

Chat bot
Journaling
Managing symptoms
Getting professional support

To run the application follow this [link](https://snack.expo.io/@opencoder/github.com-griffin-sullivan-mentalhealthchatbot) and select “My Device”.

You will need to download the Expo app on your mobile device, and then you can scan the QR code to run the application. You can check out the preview in the Web viewer, but you will not get to see all of the application, as some 3rd party libraries do not support the web view. We recommend running the app on your device, so that snack will resolve dependencies for you. 

Note: If the link above is not working, you can go to snack.expo.io and click the three dots on the left. There you can select “Import Git Repository” and paste the link to our GitHub below. Once it loads you will need to click all of the “Add dependency” buttons that pop up in the console.

If you would like, you can download the code and run `npm install` and then `expo start` in your terminal, but you could run into some dependency issues like installing 3rd party libraries. If that is the case, try `npm install --save <library>` for the library that is causing you issues. Snack will do this for you, so that is why we like to develop through their website.
